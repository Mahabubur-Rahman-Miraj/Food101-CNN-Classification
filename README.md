# Food101-CNN-Classification
For the Food101 dataset, use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. Start with data preprocessing, applying techniques like normalization and resizing. Build the CNN with layers including Conv2D, MaxPooling, Flatten, and Dense. Train the model, evaluate accuracy on the test set, and fine-tune to improve performance.
